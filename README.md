# Just another Rust-WebSocket Application

This project aims to create a rust-lang chat application to communicate between two nodes using the websocket standard.

## Why Rust?
The use of a memory safe programming language has not been well researched in the domain of websockets and I believe there is a vast array of capabilities and performance upgrades that can be made available to a chat program by using rust. The learnings from this project is to be utilised in future application projects that will handle data of varying nature, starting most probably with a **Voice over WebSocket** calling application which is also being planned. Also, as a beginner in Rust, I am extremely curious about how complex such a project can get.

## Contribution
All contributions in any form are welcome. Especially in the form of guidance, please open an issue if you find something wrong with the code and can help direct the project, but otherwise this is a learning journey I wish to make on my own.
